# About 
This project was developed during the Front-End course at the Ituring Institute of Technology. Throughout the course, we developed a web application whose function is to allow people to request a professional from the car wash company TuringWash to come to your location and wash your car without you having to leave where you are. 
Based on the User Stories, the design team developed the layout and together with a colleague we developed the four pages of the application.
